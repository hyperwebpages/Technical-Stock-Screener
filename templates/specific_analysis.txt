## Analysis per asset

In this section, you can analyse each asset separately. 

The first thing to do is to decide what to plot. 
The main plot of each asset is an OHLC chart. 
You can decide to plot other information below or on top of this this chart.

Then, there is a filter to whitelist assets meeting a specific number of conditions. 
This filter automatically gives you the assets respecting the highest number of conditions.

Finally, you can simply explore charts and raw data.
