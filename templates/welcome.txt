## Welcome !
On this page, you'll have the chance to monitor stocks.
By defining indicators and threshold, you will be able to detect in real time if a stock meets your condition.

In the whole website, we make references to a _score_. A score is simply a _buy_ or _sell_ pressure computed by indicators. Its value is in [-1, 0, +1]:
    
    * -1 means a sell pressure
    * +1 means a buy pressure
    * 0 means a neutral pressure.

### Workflow

On this website, there exists a standard Workflow to make the best out of it:

    1. First select indicators and thresholds.
    2. Click on "scan" to let the algorithm scan every stock of the S&P500. 
    If you are lucky, some stocks will meet your conditions.
    3. However, it is very rare that a stock will meet every one of your conditions. 
    This is why, you can finetune how many of those conditions you would like to see being met.
    4. You can analyse deeper the charts and the raw data.
    5. Enjoy !
